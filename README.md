## Project Objective:

This project focused on leveraging the IMDB dataset, comprising movie reviews and their associated sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).
The primary objectives are:

1. **Model Development:** Employ the IMDB dataset to engineer relevant features and train an interpretable machine learning model. This model should proficiently predict sentiment labels for each movie.

2. **Big Data Pipeline:** Construct a scalable big data pipeline designed to handle more extensive datasets in the future. This ensures the sustained capability to predict sentiment labels for each movie efficiently.

## Learning Outcomes:

This equiped me with essential skills, knowledge, and practical experience essential for tackling intricate data analysis tasks in real-world scenarios. Emphasis was on mastering sentiment analysis and big data processing within the context of the provided IMDB dataset.

## Dataset Overview:

The IMDB dataset encompasses:

1. **Movie Reviews:** Textual data containing reviews from users or critics, varying in length and content, ranging from concise comments to in-depth analyses.

2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each movie review is paired with a sentiment label indicating whether the expressed sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
