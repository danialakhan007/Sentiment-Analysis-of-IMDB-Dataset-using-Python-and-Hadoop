# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDB-Dataset-using-Python-and-Hadoop
 ## Project Overview:  This hackathon revolves around harnessing the IMDB dataset, consisting of movie reviews and corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral). The primary goals are:  1. **Model Development:** Utilize the IMDB dataset to create pertinent features and train an interpretable machine learning model capable of predicting sentiment labels for each movie.  2. **Big Data Pipeline:** Construct a scalable big data pipeline to accommodate larger datasets in the future. This ensures a sustained ability to predict sentiment labels for each movie efficiently.  ## Dataset Details:  The IMDB dataset comprises:  1. **Movie Reviews:** Textual data containing reviews from users or critics, varying in length and content, ranging from concise comments to in-depth analyses.  2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each movie review is associated with a sentiment label indicating whether the expressed sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
